                <h4>Course Description:</h4>
                <p>In this course students learn to develop skill in using logic to describe and assess arguments. Students will learn to write formulas in propositional and first-order logic, and more importantly, to write and check proofs. Students will also learn to write formulas in three-valued and modal logic, to choose an appropriate logic, and to understand the limitations of logic in capturing human reasoning.</p>
